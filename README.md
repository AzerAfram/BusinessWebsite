This website was built for my father, the owner of HMC Air Systems, an air conditioning company, visit us at hmcairsystems.com to learn more.
ALL webpages (except the 404 error webpage) have a corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file ... and nothing else.
For the contact us portions I was going to use PHP Mailer, but linking a PHP script required other unwanted changes such as changing .html files to .php.
Patches are listed on the JavaScript file for the home page (homePage.js).
