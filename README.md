This website was built for my father, the owner of HMC Air Systems, visit at hmcairsystems.com.
ALL webpages (except the 404 error webpage) have a corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files ... and nothing else.
For the contact us portions I was going to use PHP Mailer, but linking a PHP script required other unwanted changes such as changing .html files to .php.
Patches are listed on the JavaScript file for the home page (homePage.js).
